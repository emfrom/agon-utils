# Agon Utils

My own set of common utilities for MOS on the Agon Light computer. These are only loosely based on the tools for Unix-like operating systems and try to keep an extremely minimalistic set of features. Specifically the options are limited to the absolutely necessary ones.

Following Agon Light's spirit, the tools are kept as simple as possible, favouring code correctness. This approach tends to avoid bugs while at the same time providing more readable code. Ideally the code should be understandable by beginner C programmers. As an admirer of the Rust programming language, this is something important.
